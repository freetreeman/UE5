/**
 * Configuring the backend hierarchy
 * 
 * The [Core.ContentVirtualization] section can contain a string 'BackendGraph' which will set with the name of  
 * the backend graph, if not set then the default 'ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_None' will be used instead. 
 * This value can also be overridden from the command line by using 'BackendGraph=FooBar' where FooBar is the 
 * name of the graph.
 * 
 * The first entry in the graph to be parsed will be the 'Hierarchy' which describes which backends should be
 * mounted and in which order. For example 'Hierarchy=(Entry=Foo, Entry=Bar)' which should mount two backends
 * 'Foo' and 'Bar' in that order. 
 * 
 * Each referenced backend in the hierarchy will then require it's own entry in the graph where the key will be
 * it's name in the hierarchy and the value a string describing how to set it up. 
 * The value must contain 'Type=X' where X is the name used to find the correct IVirtualizationBackendFactory 
 * to create the backend with. 
 * Once the backend is created then reset of the string will be passed to it, so that additional customization
 * can be extracted. Depending on the backend implementation these values may or may not be required.
 * 
 * Example graph:
 * [ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_Example] 
 * Hierarchy=(Entry=MemoryCache, Entry=NetworkShare)
 * MemoryCache=(Type=InMemory)
 * NetworkShare=(Type=FileSystem, Path="\\path\to\somewhere")
 * 
 * The graph is named 'ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_Example'.
 * The hierarchy contains two entries 'InMemory' and 'NetworkShare' to be mounted in that order
 * MemoryCache creates a backend of type 'InMemory' and has no additional customization
 * NetworkShare creates a backend of type 'FileSystem' and provides an additional path, the filesystem backend would 
 * fatal error without this value.
