// This header exists to simplify usage of the core UE::Geometry:: math types, such as FVector3d/f, FTransform3d/f, etc. 
// The GeometryProcessing plugin used these type names for several years before the UE Core math library was extended with
// double-precision support, at which point it was decided to rename FVector as FVector3f/FVector3d, etc, creating a conflict. 
// Unfortunately the UE Core versions are not a direct replacement for the GeometryProcessing variants, because:
//   1) they have templated base classes, and significant other template code takes advantage of this. The UE Core Math types currently do not.
//   2) they use more reliable (but potentially slower) standard-library math functions
//   3) they have function naming schemes compatible with other standard vector math libraries (which simplifies porting/etc)
//   4) they have internal member differences in some case (eg UE::Geometry::FTransform3d does not use SSE, Matrix2/3/4 stores as Vectors, etc)
//
// As a result the global ::FVector3d and UE::Geometry::FVector3d names are ambiguous. To avoid requiring explicit UE::Geometry:: disambiguation 
// in all cases, which would make code harder to read and vastly complicate UE4/UE5 merging, in code that primarily uses GeometryProcessing
// types, we prefer to explicitly specify - via C++ 'using' declarations - that we are using the UE::Geometry:: types at cpp file scope.
// Rather than add a standard block of declarations into each file, this header can be included **IN THE CPP ONLY** to do so.
//
// Note that the header does not contain 'using namespace UE::Geometry;' - we leave that to the cpp file, so the standard boilerplate is:
//
//		#include "ExplicitUseGeometryMathTypes.h"		// using UE::Geometry::(math types)
//		using namespace UE::Geometry;
//
// This header **MUST NOT BE INCLUDED IN OTHER HEADERS** as this could result in ambiguous definitions for downstream includers.
// In headers, the GeometryProcessing core math types can be explicitly 'used' in other namespaces, or in class definitions, but not in global scope.
