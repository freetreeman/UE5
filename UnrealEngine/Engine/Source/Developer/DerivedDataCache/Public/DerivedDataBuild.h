 * Interface to the build system.
 *
 * Executing a build typically requires a definition, input resolver, session, and function.
 *
 * Use IBuild::CreateDefinition() to make a new build definition, or use IBuild::LoadDefinition()
 * to load a build definition that was previously saved. This references the function to execute,
 * and the inputs needed by the function.
 *
 * Use IBuild::CreateSession() to make a new build session with a build input resolver to resolve
 * input references into the referenced data. Use FBuildSession::Build() to schedule a definition
 * to build, along with any of its transitive build dependencies.
 *
 * Implement IBuildFunction, with a unique name and version, to add payloads to the build context
 * based on constants and inputs in the context. Use TBuildFunctionFactory to add the function to
 * the registry at IBuild::GetFunctionRegistry() to allow the build job to find it.
