 * Flags to control the behavior of cache requests.
 *
 * The cache policy flags can be combined to support a variety of usage patterns. Examples:
 *
 * Get(Default): read from any cache; put to writable caches if missing.
 * Get(Remote): read any remote cache; put to writable remote caches if missing.
 * Get(Local): read any local cache; put to writable local caches if missing.
 * Get(Query | StoreRemote): read from any cache; put to writable remote caches if missing.
 * Get(Query | StoreLocal): read from any cache; put to writable local caches if missing.
 * Get(Query | SkipData): check for existence in any cache; do not modify any cache.
 * Get(Default | SkipData): check for existence in any cache; put to writable caches if missing.
 * Get(Default | SkipLocalCopy): read from any cache; put to writable remote caches if missing,
 *                               and to writable local caches if not present in any local cache.
 *
 * Put(Default): write to every writable cache.
 * Put(Remote): write to every writable remote cache, skipping local caches.
 * Put(Local): write to every writable local cache, skipping remote caches.
